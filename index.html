        <li><strong>Website Content</strong>: We collect information from LinkedIn pages, including profile information (your name, role, company, and headline) and recipient information (name and headline) to provide context for AI suggestions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>
        We use the collected data solely for the purpose of providing AI-powered text assistance for LinkedIn messages. Specifically:

    </ul>
